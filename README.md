# 🛒 Amazon Sales Analytics (SQL Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end SQL analytics** using the **Amazon Sales Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains customer orders, product categories, sales, discounts, and profit information.  
I extended it by adding **timestamps** to each order, which allows exploration of **date/time functions**,  
seasonality, and customer purchasing behavior.

This repository is structured to reflect a **real-world data analytics workflow**:  
- Data extraction & schema creation  
- Data loading into SQL database  
- Data cleaning & enrichment  
- Analytical queries (aggregations, joins, case when, window functions)  
- Optimization (indexes & views)
